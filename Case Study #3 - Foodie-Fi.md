## A. Based off the 8 sample customers provided in the sample from the subscriptions table, write a brief description about each customerâ€™s onboarding journey.
````sql
    SELECT s.customer_id, s.start_date, p.plan_name, p.price
    FROM subscriptions s
    JOIN plans p
    	ON s.plan_id = p.plan_id
    WHERE s.customer_id <= 8
    ORDER BY s.customer_id, s.start_date;
````
| customer_id | start_date | plan_name     | price  |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------- | ------ |
| 1           | 2020-08-01 | trial         | 0.00   |
| 1           | 2020-08-08 | basic monthly | 9.90   |
| 2           | 2020-09-20 | trial         | 0.00   |
| 2           | 2020-09-27 | pro annual    | 199.00 |
| 3           | 2020-01-13 | trial         | 0.00   |

| 7           | 2020-05-22 | pro monthly   | 19.90  |
| 8           | 2020-06-11 | trial         | 0.00   |
| 8           | 2020-06-18 | basic monthly | 9.90   |
| 8           | 2020-08-03 | pro monthly   | 19.90  |

## B. Data Analysis  
** 1. How many customers has Foodie-Fi ever had?
````sql
    SELECT count(distinct customer_id)
    FROM subscriptions;
````
| count |
| ----- |
| 1000  |

** 2. What is the monthly distribution of trial plan start_date values for our dataset - use the start of the month as the group by value
````sql
    SELECT date_trunc('month', start_date) as month_start,
    count(*) as trial_count
    FROM subscriptions
    WHERE plan_id = 0
    GROUP BY month_start
    ORDER BY month_start;
````
| month_start            | trial_count |
| ---------------------- | ----------- |
| 2020-01-01 00:00:00+00 | 88          |
| 2020-02-01 00:00:00+00 | 68          |
| 2020-03-01 00:00:00+00 | 94          |
| 2020-04-01 00:00:00+00 | 81          |
| 2020-05-01 00:00:00+00 | 88          |
| 2020-06-01 00:00:00+00 | 79          |
| 2020-07-01 00:00:00+00 | 89          |
| 2020-08-01 00:00:00+00 | 88          |
| 2020-09-01 00:00:00+00 | 87          |
| 2020-10-01 00:00:00+00 | 79          |
| 2020-11-01 00:00:00+00 | 75          |
| 2020-12-01 00:00:00+00 | 84          |

** 3. What plan start_date values occur after the year 2020 for our dataset? Show the breakdown by count of events for each plan_name
````sql
    SELECT p.plan_name, count (p.plan_name) as count_plan
    FROM plans p
    JOIN subscriptions s
    	ON p.plan_id = s.plan_id
    WHERE start_date >= '2021-01-01'
    GROUP BY p.plan_name;
````

| plan_name     | count_plan |
| ------------- | ---------- |
| pro annual    | 63         |
| churn         | 71         |
| pro monthly   | 60         |
| basic monthly | 8          |

** 4. What is the customer count and percentage of customers who have churned rounded to 1 decimal place?
````sql
    WITH churn_customer AS (
      SELECT count(distinct customer_id) as churn_count
      FROM subscriptions
      WHERE plan_id = 4
      ),
      total_customer AS (
      SELECT count(distinct customer_id) as total_count
      FROM subscriptions
      )
    
    SELECT c.churn_count as customer_count,
    	ROUND(c.churn_count::DECIMAL/t.total_count * 100, 1) as customer_percentage
    FROM churn_customer c
    CROSS JOIN total_customer t;
````

| customer_count | customer_percentage |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| 307            | 30.7                |

** 5. How many customers have churned straight after their initial free trial - what percentage is this rounded to the nearest whole number?
- Using self-join to separate plan_id 0 and 4 into 2 separate columns and join on customer_id
- Filter out a table with customer starts with trial followed by churn immediately
````sql
    WITH trial_churn_filter AS (
    SELECT s1.customer_id
    FROM subscriptions s1
    JOIN subscriptions s2
    ON s1.customer_id = s2.customer_id
    WHERE s1.plan_id = 0 and s2.plan_id = 4 -- Extract customer_id with both trial and churn date
    AND s1.start_date < s2.start_date -- Churn date (4) has be after trial date (0)
    AND NOT EXISTS -- Check no other plans exist between trial (0) and churn (4) using a middle table
    (SELECT 1
     FROM subscriptions s3
     WHERE s3.customer_id = s1.customer_id
     AND s3.start_date < s2.start_date
     AND s3.start_date > s1.start_date)
    ),
    total_customer AS (
    SELECT count(distinct customer_id) as total_count
    FROM subscriptions
    ),
    churn_customer AS (
    SELECT count(distinct customer_id) as churn_count
    FROM trial_churn_filter
    )
    
    Select cc.churn_count as customer_count,
    round(cc.churn_count::decimal/tc.total_count * 100, 0) as customer_percentage
    from churn_customer cc
    cross join total_customer tc;
````
| customer_count | customer_percentage |
| -------------- | ------------------- |
| 92             | 9                   |
